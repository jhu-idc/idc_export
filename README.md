# iDC Citation and Export Metadata Module
This is an Work in Progress and currently doesn't work. Mostly is just a shell and maybe will go nowhere, overall. 

Eventually this module will do two things: 
  * help create bibliographic citations for repository items in Islandora
  * export metadata in CSV format for a group of repository items. 

## Bibliographic Citations

## Metadata Export
